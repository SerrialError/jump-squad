# Jump Squad

A volunteering app that helps you connect and participate in volunteering across the city of Las Vegas. Includes statistics, tracking, goals, and a directory to help you with volunteering life. Currently in development.

## How to run Jump Squad?

### Prerequisites
You will need latest version of Node JS, Supabase configuration, and backend with Axios for email sending (To do that you can just get the other backend branch of this project).
Supabase configuration and backend will have to be developed yourself as they are not provided.
You will also have to provide your own API keys.

### Commands

First, run
```
npm i
```
to install all the necessary packages as there are many.

To start, if you are on Windows you can run -
```
npm run start-windows
```
If you are on Mac/Linux/UNIX-based OS you can run -
```
npm run start-linux
```
