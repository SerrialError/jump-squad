Whether itâ€™s through organizing events, participating in local service projects, or offering a helping hand to those in need, we are committed to being the hands and feet of Christ in our community.</p>
	<p>Our mission is guided by the Christian virtues of love, hope, and faith. We believe that when we come together in the spirit of Christ, we can achieve great things and make a profound impact on the lives of others.
